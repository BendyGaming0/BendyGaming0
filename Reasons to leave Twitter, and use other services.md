# Reasons to leave Twitter, and reasons to use other micro-blogging social medias

Before you go *"I ain't reading allat"*, scroll to the bottom for a summary (its still more than one sentence though). If you weren't gonna be like that, then continue.

## Why leave twitter?
Throughout the past few years after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter (and his renaming of the service to X) the service has been on a decline, especially recently where much of Elon's political ideology has been showing up and affecting users, especially those of minorities.
In response, many people have been switching to alternatives to Elon's Twitter, most notably tumblr and Bluesky, with Bluesky being a much younger and developing platform showing many similarities in interface design and basic feature implementation

## You don't need to leave, at least make an account
I get it, its no guarantee I can convince you to outright leave Twitter, theres probably some reason I can't convince you otherwise to keep your Twitter, but I at the least ask you make an account and be somewhat active in the hopes that it can convince others to come to whatever platform you choose. Maybe interact with your friend's posts there, like the stuff your favorite artist makes, maybe post all the art you make there too. You will **NOT** have as much interaction as you had on Twitter at the start, but that should be a given since that isn't where you built your little (or big) community.

## My experience on Bluesky currently
I joined Bluesky about a year ago (Feb. 6th, 2024) but i didn't really start posting until about 7 months later (Sept. 2024) and let me be honest, no one was interacting or really noticing my posts ðŸ˜­. But I didn't just go "Welp, this didn't work out, back to suffering on hell on earth the website" I decided to continue using Bluesky cause even if it was slow both in what I was seeing on my timeline and interactions on my posts, I was still genuinely enjoying my experience on Bluesky.

### My experience on tumblr..?

I would talk about my experience on tumblr... but right now I don't really have anything to say, I still need to use it more.

## A list of reasons to NOT use Twitter

- ### Elon Musk

    personally this should be self explanatory, Elon Musk owns Twitter and is nowhere near being a good person anymore, he's been encouraging Transphobic, Racist and other discriminatory practices on his platform. Continuing to actively use his platform and have an account aids in the support of it whether its through ads you see on Twitter, or the very fact you count towards the millions of still active users on his platform (which looks good on company reports)

- ### Unfriendly to off-platform links and references

    it's been known for a while that Twitter does not like links to other platforms which can be an issue for content creators promoting their creations on other platforms like YouTube, but some creators rely on these other platforms such as Pintrest and Bandcamp for a source of revenue. Not only that but *allegedly* while many people were moving to Bluesky, posts referring to bluesky were intentionally not being shown on peoples timelines, assumedly to discourage people to switch over to the friendlier, alternative platform.

- ### Bot accounts

    While claiming to have fixed this problem, its still prevalent for many people as replies are filled with scams and fake people. This makes it more difficult for peoples actual replies and posts to reach real people with real interest in what others are posting. However, it should be addressed that the main two alternatives, tumblr and Bluesky can still have bot posts and replies, however from personal experience and the limited knowledge of other peoples experiences that bots are handled by moderation better, just remember that stuff is less likely to happen to these accounts if you don't report them. REPORT BOT ACCOUNTS!

- ### Grok

    While grok has mostly stayed out of the way, recently prompts to re-create artworks with AI have been appearing on people's artworks. Honestly, ill keep this one at is, if this doesn't seem like a genuine reason, maybe you should stay.

- ### Handling of NSFW content

    A while ago, an attempt to cover up how they were handling NSFW was made by Twitter "officially allowing" NSFW content on the platform, even though, its always been there... Its also known that Twitter has often wrongly flagged SFW (mostly suggestive) posts as NSFW restricting what would be content acceptable for people of all ages (or at least, 16 as decided by most of the communities ive seen) to only be seen by those who have their account age set to 18 or higher.

- ### Users and moderation decisions aligning with Germany WWII

    Quite recently events transpired relating to a very popular musical artist on Twitter exclaiming some, concerning things, however, no action was taken on their account. Also, Twitter has *allegedly* been showing adverts for people apologizing for a certain man from WWII claiming that the education system has been "brainwashing" people and such.

- #### Ow, my hand burns :\(

    This only affects usage on older mobile devices (my case being a third generation iPhone SE) but being a social media that Twitter is, performance on older devices is an expectation, but no, it burns my hand when I use it for too long. Twitter is not optimized.

## Counterarguments against some reasons to continue using Twitter

- ### This type of content isn't on Bluesky/tumblr/ect.

    Well the best way to get a type of content on a platform is to put it on the platform yourself and to get a community of people who enjoy that type of content. However, this only really applies to newer platforms like Bluesky, chances are that whatever you're looking for probably exists on tumblr as well.

- ### This person isn't on Bluesky/tumblr/ect.

    Well, if it isn't some absolutely massive celebrity figure chances are you could reach out to them and maybe you and some friends can encourage them to at the least make an account on another platform (maybe you could send them this thing :3c), remember not to force them, and if they ask you to stop, then stop. Also as mentioned before, the act of making an account on one of these alternative platforms can help encourage them since knowing your community already exists on another platform is good motivation to make an account there. 

- ### Re-finding who I followed on Twitter is hard

    Many people use websites like strawpage, carrd, pronouns.page and other things to link all their social medias on one site which is a good place to start. In the case of Bluesky you can use Sky Follower Bridge ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sky-follower-bridge/behhbpbpmailcnfbjagknjngnfdojpko?pli=1), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/sky-follower-bridge/) and [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-follower-bridge/id6738878242?mt=12)) to help find most of your followers on Bluesky. If you're friends with them on Discord, chances are they have a connection to their Bluesky account. (sadly, Discord does not have tumblr connections)

- ### Bluesky/tumblr/ect. is an echo-chamber

    I mean, making your feed an echo-chamber is by design, it makes you interact more, its just that more recently the general platform has been pushing towards echoing a certain set of voices, mostly of far right opinion. Twitter is an echo-chamber, it's probably how you heard about these platforms being echo-chambers, because since you still use Twitter, it's probably what you want to hear, and the chamber provides you a reason. The only way to not have your feed be an echo-chamber is to not make it an echo-chamber because if you want an echo-chamber, you'll get an echo-chamber, reach out and interact with new people.

- ### My friend(s)/partner(s) don't want me to use Bluesky/tumblr/ect.

    You should be the one to make your own decisions, if your friend(s)/partner(s) don't want to use another platform, that's fine, but if they're telling you that you shouldn't or can't use another platform, that isn't fine and you should tell them that. If a friend/partner is threatening you in some way at the idea of you switching or using another platform, you should talk to them or if they've been doing other things similar to this, think about how they're directly influencing your decisions and whether its healthy. This goes the other way around with the idea of *not* moving to another platform, that isn't good either, please be patient and respectful with other's decisions to move or not and when they may do so.

- #### I'm too lazy

    I'm sorry? What? Not to be rude but get off your lazy ass, that's not really a good excuse. Doing the bare minimum which is creating an account isn't hard, and at least interacting a bit isn't hard either. Plus, continuing to use Twitter through its glaring issues that affect more than just you can't be easier than at least starting to switch to a new platform.
    <sup><sub>(also sorry to that one person, you know who you are, I know this feels targeted but I knew other people would come up with this excuse)</sup></sub>

## A list of reasons to USE Bluesky

- ### Open Source

    Many aspects of Bluesky, most notably the Open Standard for their Social Networking Protocol known as "AT Protocol" and the source code for the Bluesky app itself. If you don't like how the Bluesky app works, if its reasonable you can create an Issue on the GitHub (or even a *Pull Request* if you're a bit of a tech savvy) or find an alternative app that lets you access Bluesky

- ### Familiar interface

    Bluesky's UI is very much inspired by Twitter's, so switching over hopefully wont destroy your muscle memory. However, there are small differences here and there which can kinda suck and can make things inconvenient sometimes, but adjusting to a new platform takes time so hopefully this isn't a deal-breaker

- ### Customizable feeds

    By default you're given the "Following" and "Discover" feeds, but not only does Bluesky have a few more feeds provided by them such as a "Mutuals" feed and "Popular with Friends" feed, but users can create their own feeds, and many aren't just glorified lists actually being based off how the poster relates to you, your followers and your following, and the content of the posts themselves.

- ### Moderation Lists

    Moderation lists are a type of list specifically made to mute and or block a TON of users, pretty helpful to keep Transphobes and other bad people off the timeline and out of the replies.

- ### Blocking works

    Bluesky, when creating its platform decided to *REVOLUTIONIZE* the block feature by making it so that when you block a user, they can no longer see or interact with *ANY* of your posts. **AND**, blocking accounts blurs their profile to hide any unpleasant images they may have chosen. But seriously, blocking is more effective here, and its important to stay safe on the internet.

- ### Labelers

    There exists a special type of account known as a labeler, infact, Bluesky's moderation works through a mandatory labeler. Labelers place labels onto posts and users that only people subscribed to the labeler can see, and posts/users can be hidden or have a warning when labelled if a subscriber chooses so. One of the most popular labeler accounts is [@pronouns.diy](https://bsky.app/profile/pronouns.diy) which is intended to show people's preferred pronouns on their account, and because of how account labels work, they appear on all posts too! (as long as you're subscribed that is)

- ### Self-applied labels on posts

    Not only can you mark if your content is intended for adults, but theres more options for what labels you can apply to your content outside of just adult or mature content. Content with self-applied labels will still reach the same people, minus people who have set to hide any posts with the tag, but they have it set to that for a reason, and you shouldn't get mad at other's peoples choices on what content they don't want to see

- ### Bluesky is a Public Benefit Corporation

    The main purpose of Bluesky as a company is to benefit the public, im not gonna do a good job explaining this so heres the Wikipedia article about PBCs [right here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation)

- ### Adoption by Companies

    Whether or not this is really a good point is up to you but companies such as Ubisoft have begun to make accounts on Bluesky, and we hope that other companies such as Nintendo make the move as well.

- ### Domain Handles

    Most users have @***username***.bsky.social as their handle, but if you own a domain, you can set that as your handle rather than the default which is really helpful for verifying that an account belongs to someone.

- #### No Ads

    Self explanatory.

- #### toby fox

    toby fox and his roast chicken is on bluesky

## A short list of reasons to USE tumblr

- ### Established platform

    Unlike Bluesky, tumblr has been around for a long while, only being just under a year younger than Twitter.

- ### More customization

    A lot of stuff about your blog can be changed using CSS and HTML, but even without that you can change stuff like the colors and font used on your page.

Sorry, but i haven't used tumblr nearly as much as Bluesky... but also, some of the points i already covered as to why you should consider using Bluesky apply to tumblr as well, and i don't want to cover the same point twice.

## Summary
Twitter has been on the decline with issues relating to user safety when interacting, bots, AI, is not a friendly place to content creators and artists and its owner has been creating more issues many of which relating to politics. However, alternatives that provide similar experiences such as tumblr and Bluesky with their own advantages over Twitter exist and are growing with helpful features like in the case of Bluesky with feeds, moderation lists, and labelers while being adopted by companies and popular figures such as Toby Fox.
